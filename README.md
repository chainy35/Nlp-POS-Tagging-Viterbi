# Nlp-POS-Tagging-Viterbi
A natural language process application that implements the bigram Viterbi algorithm applied to part-of-speech(POS) tagging.
The result of the Viterbi algorithm program which calculating the best probability of 
the sequence of POS corresponding to the given sample sentences assigns the 
possible POS sequence. For these given sentences, the result makes sense as human judgement. 
# How to Run the Program
